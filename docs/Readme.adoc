== Running

In order to run the Cloud DJ demo, start a Docker container from the following image with following exposed ports:

  -p 8002:8002 \
  -p 4558:4558 \
  sdaschner/sonicpi-clouddj:build-1

The Docker container should now startup. There might be a few warnings in the container output related to the internal audio system which can be disregarded.

The Cloud DJ console can be accessed via `http://localhost:8001`.
